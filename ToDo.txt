Things that I want to work on...

Near term / in progress
- Scene serialisation
- Materials and lighting
	- clean up engine shaders to move common code into include file
- Model/mesh loading
- Scene UI work
	- maintain focus on selected entity on destroy
	- auto expand hierarchy on create
	- load new textures
	- load new skybox textures
	- model loading
- Alternative cameras
- ECS
	- create systems rather than hard coding in scene
	- use case of mulitple components for a single entity
- Particle system
	- add an emit direction, and use transform to change it
- Bugs
	- Skybox doesn't check that it's valid before rendering
- Proper error handling and logging
	- use exceptions

Long term
- Rigid body and basic physics
- shadows
- water
- boids


Future?
