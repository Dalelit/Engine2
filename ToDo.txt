Things that I want to work on...

Near term / in progress
- Scene serialisation
- Rendering, Materials and lighting
	- clean up engine shaders to move common code into include file
	- have each render step set the state, rather than rely on the default state
	- create a render pipeline to manage stages
- Model/mesh loading
- Scene UI work
	- maintain focus on selected entity on destroy
	- auto expand hierarchy on create
	- load new textures
	- load new skybox textures
	- model loading
- ECS
	- create systems rather than hard coding in scene
	- use case of mulitple components for a single entity
	- HasComponents test for multiple components at time
	- Callback method for when a component is added to allow an initialisation if required. (e.g. via the gui adding a camera needs the aspect ratio set)
	- Work out a way to register components better than current Componets class
- Particle system
	- add an emit direction, and use transform to change it
- Bugs
	- Skybox doesn't check that it's valid before rendering
	- Deleting main camera causing things to crash
	- Camera rotation around z. Gizmo changes but camera is locked.
	- Offscreen targets need to render subdisplay using the aspect ratio
- Proper error handling and logging
	- use exceptions

Long term
- Rigid body and basic physics
- shadows
- water
- boids


Future?
- Use yaml
